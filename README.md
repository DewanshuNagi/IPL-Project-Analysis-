IPL Data Analysis Project

Project Description

This project focuses on analyzing Indian Premier League (IPL) data to extract meaningful insights. The data was uploaded to Databricks using Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) and Blob Storage, processed in Databricks notebooks, and visualized for better understanding.

Objective

To analyze and derive insights from IPL datasets.

To visualize key metrics and trends in IPL performance data.


Datasets

1. Primary Dataset:

Contains detailed IPL match data, such as team performances, player statistics, and match outcomes.



2. Supplementary Datasets:

Additional datasets used for advanced analysis, such as player details, team records, or stadium data.




Tools and Technologies

Databricks: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.

Azure Blob Storage & ADLS Gen2: For secure data storage.

Python: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data handling and visualizations.


Project Workflow

1. Data Ingestion:

IPL datasets were uploaded to Azure Blob Storage and ADLS Gen2.

Imported into Databricks for analysis.



2. Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values, standardized formats, and ensured data consistency.



3. Data Analysis:

Explored trends such as top-performing teams, players, and venues.

Derived statistics like the highest runs scored, most wickets taken, and win probabilities.



4. Visualization:

Visualized data in Databricks using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Created graphs such as bar plots, scatter plots, and pie charts to represent insights.




Key Insights

Teams with the highest win rates.

Players with the most Man of the Match awards.

Impact of toss decisions on match outcomes.

Comparison of performance across different seasons.


How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git


2. Open the Databricks notebook in your Databricks workspace.


3. Ensure you have access to the datasets in Azure Blob Storage or ADLS Gen2.


4. Follow the notebook instructions to run the analysis and visualize results.



Visualization Samples

Include example visualizations here (e.g., screenshots of plots or charts).

Future Scope

Include advanced machine learning models to predict match outcomes.

Perform sentiment analysis on fan tweets during IPL matches.

Add more datasets for enriched insights.
